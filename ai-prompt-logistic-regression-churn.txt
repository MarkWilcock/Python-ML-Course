Write the Python code to build a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
Assume that a DataFrame, df, already exists and has the following columns
* Gender: (male, female)
* Geography: (France, Germany, Spain)
* Age: - an integer
* Exited: - the label, either 1 (the customer has churned) or 0 (the customer has not churned)

The code must
- split data into training and test datasets
- fit the model to the training data
- predict the test  values
- compare predicted and actual test data labels to evaluate the performance of the model
